var tedExText = "hello hello again I am extremely excited to talk about this thing called the silicon road the silicon road the concept is a bold new direction for us as individuals not so much for us as a state because our state has been there before this isn't something new for Rhode Island this talk is about how innovation is deeply ingrained into the DNA of our great state and what this means is that we have to really reflect upon and change the way we think about how we're gonna bring about economic sustainability and viability for our citizens I like to frame this question or this concept with a question what is one thing that you know that you believe deeply in your heart that 99 percent of the people that you know don't believe they're in complete disagreement with that's a tough one but it is the very definition of innovation and it's what's propelled great societies from one level to the next to the next for as long as humanity has existed this is the foundation of great ideas and when we look at Rhode Island the ocean state as they've called it affectionately since 1972 it was created by the powers that be at that time to help boost our economic situation because we were depleted there weren't many jobs and things weren't going well but it was an anchor that they had tossed overboard even though that they are they had already seen that the tide had already gone back out to sea something like someone like this right and the innovation that's in our state began with our founder Roger Williams he had one of those ideas that 99% of people in the colonies completely disagreed with he wasn't welcome anywhere no one wanted his ideas they wanted to execute him from Massachusetts so what did he do he founded his own state and that's what great innovators do they don't ask for permission they don't care who you are if you're a gate keeper what authority you have they simply make it happen and he was a great innovator ingrained in his DNA shortly after Roger Williams we had another M another innovator that came to our country as an immigrant now this is Samuel Slater he came from he was born in Derbyshire England and I don't know about you but soon as I read that he's from the Shire I went online I started looking up and googling and that's it ok how tall is he is he four foot because anyone who's born in the Shire has to be a hobbit you know like the Lord of the Rings or in his case the Lord of the mills and when Samuel Slater came here he connected with another great innovator an independent thinker someone whose counterintuitive from even his own brother this was Moses Brown and it's interesting that they teamed up and connected he and Moses Brown and he and John Brown because they were both divergent counterintuitive fingers and slayed his mill this is what they built right here in Pawtucket right this sparked the birthplace of the American industrial revolution for our entire nation business began booming so much that anyone who was able to work got a job and unemployment was down at 0% even if you were in grade school they were going into 4th grade classes and plucking kids out come on kid you got a job like what do I do your fingers are small they can fit in there get the work right is there a cran in there yeah there's a cran in there keep keep prodding and it really caused an explosion of economic activity not only for our state but for our entire nation and before you knew it word began to get out not just throughout the US but around the globe and in masse people began immigrating to the United States it was the greatest wave of immigration that the country had ever seen up into that point and they came through Ellis Island but they didn't stop there they came to Rhode Island because they knew that they this is where the jobs were this is where it was hot this is where it was happening and shortly after that another type of individual began immigrating and these were the educated the elite the business minded the entrepreneurs and most importantly the innovators around the world began coming here from all walks of life different countries Rhode Island was the most economically diverse place on the face of the planet in that diversity the different differentiation of thoughts came together and they cascade and they were like atoms colliding and they created a new era of prosperity a hundred years later from 1790 to 1890 another economic boom was created and one that very few people know about everyone knows about Samuel Slater I ask it raise your hands you raised two of them but people very few people know about this that Providence became the home of the five industrial wonders of the world how many people knew that and it was amazing because you had this cataclysm of education which was being spurred by Brown University Roger Williams University and these other schools meeting with these immigrants coming from different nations and Providence is so small and geographically tight that as people came together you couldn't go from your house down the street without running into another divergent thinker and it just exploded and created the five greatest companies at that time that the world had ever seen that's pretty amazing that Providence and this is an actual thing you can google it this isn't something that I just put up on a slide check it out we were home to the world's largest precision tool maker and this company is called brown and sharp they made micrometer x' and other precision measurement instruments that were needed to fuel the Industrial Revolution and they could if you look at this picture here there's a building here that was their first one a year later they had to build another one a year later another one they were building buildings on top of buildings and if they could have they woulda started building buildings under buildings the demand was simply off the charts for their tools and their instruments and after them next to them we created the world's largest file factory now ladies don't be jealous these aren't the type of files that you use when you go get your nails did these are files that craftsmen and women used to make for woodworking in metalworking they were making doors and desks chairs and horse-drawn carriages and they had to they were artists and they had to file the edges to make their product smooth and graceful and elegant but the world's largest file factory was right here and it was the Nicholson file fact file company after them we had the world's largest steam engine company and everyone knows the significance of the steam engine and its impact on American society but again the greatest steam engine manufacturer was Corliss right here in Providence and but wait there's more there's another one the world's largest silverware Factory right here in Providence they were producing they couldn't produce so we're fast enough to keep up with America's growing appetite and you've heard of the same people born with a silver spoon in their mouths or Providence that was probably no place more likely in the world after them the company that was going on manufacturing the world's largest screw company when you think of screws I look at the stage in there all around me and they're screws in your chairs and we don't even think about screws in any special sense they're commoditize item but at this time they were the silicon chips of their era and the American screw company was a number one company in the world that produced screws these companies grew they exploded in growth jobs grew the employment section of newspapers were thicker than the news sections of newspapers and those were all because of the convergence of Education innovation hard-working people that wanted to make a better life for the light for themselves and they created the five industrial wonders of the world is one more there's a bonus that often isn't mentioned in this in this life but is fruit of the Loom now no one's wearing it today because well maybe I am underoos but for the loom of Rhode Island based company right here and there are economic giants that propelled the American Industrial Age to the forefront of the world and put us on the stage being a small state was not a disadvantage it was an advantage you didn't need to have five million people in your city to be great all you needed where some of the world's greatest innovators people like yourself as I look out at this audience I see every race and ethnicity creed color background gender orientation there were people like you and that's really what it's gonna take as we move forward there's actually an interesting statement if you look at the the slide here three things that Providence was one of the richest cities in America in the 1900s that it was the hub of the nation's greatest industrialized state and look at this ah something interesting they say that it was considered to be an early day Silicon Valley of cutting-edge technology a lot of people think that the first innovative Valley began in California I beg to differ I think that it began in a Blackstone Valley what do you guys think this is Mike Stan popular journalist and began in Rhode Island made in Rhode Island innovated in Rhode Island started in Rhode Island that was the buzz that spread across the planet if you want to know what's new what's great what's amazing go to Rhode Island that's where you'll find it so what happened we lost our way we began to think that tourism and maybe tennis was gonna be the next great thing or sailing I wish I had my cardigan over my shoulders wrapped around here right we built great mansions in the economy tanked I have a saying movements beginning caves and they die in castles when we get comfortable we lose our way [Applause] so how are we going to repave our silicon Road it begins where it began with education and we have two great book ends we have Brown University one of the world's greatest research organizations and then we have RISD one of the greatest design organizations and institutions and in between there we have so many other great colleges and universities that are primed and ready to create that mix that we need to really propel us into the future we've also done something interesting recently that only one of four states have done and that is we've given away free Community College to all of our citizens [Applause] and this is because of the leadership at the top governor Raimondo Merrill orsa and so many other of our elected political officials have come together to not compete or one-up one another but governor Raimondo has done such an amazing job to cs4 rrri in so many other initiatives she's attracted top technical organizations to our state but she also believes that in governor I hope you're okay with this but there's also talent here in the state that can create the next five great industrial revolutions for not just this country but for the world on Monday of this past week there was a groundbreaking and they were digging up dirt in the old jewelry district and burying it and Wexford science and technology partnered with brown University the Cambridge information sent Innovation Center as well as Johnson & Johnson and a host of other key partners to create a new Innovation Center that is really going to serve as the up center of innovation for the state you have Brown University education Wexford Science and Technology Cambridge Innovation Center innovation and companies like Johnson & Johnson and people like yourselves that will go there to contemplate what's the next great thing for our state and there are many other companies that are doing great things there's too much time to name them all but some of them here we have emoney intends on emoney is a newcomer to the state Tenzin's been around for a while and they're employing people in the software development fields and there are companies in organizations like CCRI in Rhode Island College that are have two-year programs that will help you get started in that pathway to becoming employed in gaining $80,000 a year jobs after two years of employment these schools are also working with high schools so now high school students can start taking classes while they're in their junior and senior year and graduate and then go straight into the workforce like they were able to do during the industrial revolution and they don't have to stick their fingers into little machines anymore other companies like tech hire and general assembly are working hard to train people in 3-month cohorts to get people into the software development field and then there are a couple of companies at the bottom that I'm really I have our warm space in my heart for and they are intra-city geeks and career dudes interested in geek same career devs are two companies that I started alongside Clifton Sean year and Rapala Stinky's and without their help and our partnerships from waterFire Providence and oh I see of Rhode Island none of these things that we're doing today would be possible and here's a picture of our class the current Korea Deb's class standing on the deck of the water fire building the water fire Art Center and I want to talk about a cup of these students briefly one of the students Jose two months ago I gave him a challenge I gave him a Christmas gift in the middle of the summer I said Jose this is a remote-control car here's a Raspberry Pi a fisheye camera lens here's a link to Google's tens or flow and open CV open computer vision which is machine learning artificial intelligence programming I said I'm gonna give you one month to get this thing to go around and around a track by itself no hands look mom gives a new meaning to three weeks we did a demonstration he grabbed the car up and the car went crazy it started attacking everyone in the room we're all like really run away run away and so Jose left but then a few weeks later he sent me a picture of video of him in the car going around a track that he had spray-painted onto his driveway at his house in the car made it all the way around by itself using artificial intelligence that was like a moon landing and it was a huge Jose was so excited in the background I think I can see his wife she was not really excited looking at the driveway she was like I don't know it's like now I knew she was now I want you to program that thing to clean that to track up by itself after Jose there's another student named faith faith started our class and from the beginning she has a great job it's really brilliant mine but computational and algorithmic thinking wasn't her strong suit and halfway through she was kind of thinking I could see she was on a fence about stepping out but as the people in creatives all that you know that it's like the Hotel California once you check in we don't let you you out and but something she just kept going at it and sticking with it and something clicked a few weeks ago like said last week cliff ran a report to see who the top performance in the class were and she was in the top five and you can see her posts on social media now she's getting it she loves it she has a hunger and a passion for it this wouldn't have been possible just five years ago it is today the next person I want to talk about is cliff he started out coming to code night with the mare that I did with Mary Laura and he was an average programmer back then but something happened with him as well and he is now a freak of nature I think he has like an on and off switch a microchip embedded in his brain somewhere and last year Harvin had a programming competition Harbor University his team tied for first place out of 639 teams his team with only one of 11 that's high soon after that a friend of mine she's a former Google employee and she's here in the audience today maram Ibrahim said hey are now I have this idea for this really cool social network based location driven professional networking application called common connect do you know of anyone who can develop it cliff and so cliff has created this amazing new york-based app in its design right here in Providence those are the type of things you'll be hearing about common connected in the weeks and days to come and you're gonna say hey that app is created here in Providence and so in conclusion we're working in high schools like Times Square STEM Academy we're also in Time Square is doing amazing things they were ranked the fifth best school in the state this year and that's a school that's predominantly students of color low income and that's a tremendous feat dr. Rudy Mosley is doing an amazing job there next month we begin working with Rogers High School in Newport and we're so so excited about that maybe we'll get a boat and go boating and do some coding on one of their yachts down there but the silicon road it's up to you to pave it it's up to your innovative ideas don't follow the herd dig deep because our mix is just what we need just the thing we need to create the primordial child chowder you know they say the primordial soup in Rhode Island we call the primordial chowder and this silicon road is going to be the birthplace of the next five industrial revolutions for the next hundred years my name is arnelle Milhouse thank you very much";
